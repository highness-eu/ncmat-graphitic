## Generation of ncmat files

### Graphite oxides

The ncmat files of graphite oxides and fullerite (C60) are generated by

the NCrystal internal tool NCMATComposer.

The cif file and the phonon density of states (PDOS) are provided by Marco 
Bernasconi and Debdipto Acharya from Universit√† di Milano-Bicocca.
