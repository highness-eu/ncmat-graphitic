## Generation of ncmat files

### Graphite oxides and fullerite

The ncmat files of graphite oxides and fullerite (C60) are generated by 
Shuqi Xu on behalf of the Work Package 2 of the HighNESS project using 
the NCrystal internal tool NCMATComposer.

The cif file and the phonon density of states (PDOS) are provided by Marco 
Bernasconi and Debdipto Acharya from Universit√† di Milano-Bicocca. 

### Graphite intercalation compounds

The ncmat files of graphite oxides and fullerite (C60) are generated by 
Douglas D. DiJulio on behalf of the Work Package 2 of the HighNESS project 
using the NCrystal internal tool NCMATComposer.

The cif files are from Material Project and the Debye model is used for PDOS.
